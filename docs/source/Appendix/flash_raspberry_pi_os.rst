Flash Raspberry Pi OS
=====================

This guide uses Raspberry Pi Imager to write the operating system to a microSD
card. Complete this process before installing the HAT so that you can configure
the network and SSH before the first startup, without connecting a monitor or
keyboard.

What You Need
-------------

* A working microSD card and card reader.
* An internet-connected Windows, macOS, or Linux computer.
* Raspberry Pi Imager, available from the
  `official Raspberry Pi software page <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_.

Write the Operating System
--------------------------

1. **Select the Raspberry Pi model.**

   On the ``Device`` screen, select the Raspberry Pi model you are using, then
   click ``NEXT``.

2. **Select the operating system.**

   Select ``Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)``. This project has been verified with the
   Trixie release of Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit. If the image released on June 18,
   2026 is available, use it for the initial installation.

3. **Select the microSD card.**

   On the ``Storage`` screen, check the capacity and device name, then select
   the microSD card on which you want to install the operating system.

   .. warning::
      Writing the operating system erases all data on the selected storage
      device. Make sure you selected the intended microSD card, not a USB drive
      or external drive containing important data.

4. **Set the hostname.**

   On the ``Hostname`` screen, enter an easy-to-recognize device name, such as
   ``raspberrypi``. On a local network that supports mDNS, you can later try to
   reach the device at ``raspberrypi.local``.

5. **Set the locale and time zone.**

   On the ``Localisation`` screen, select the time zone and keyboard layout for
   your region.

6. **Create a login user.**

   Set a username and password for the Raspberry Pi and keep them in a safe
   place. You will use these credentials to log in through SSH.

7. **Configure Wi-Fi.**

   Enter the name and password of the Wi-Fi network that the Raspberry Pi will
   use, then confirm the country or region for the wireless network.

8. **Enable SSH.**

   On the ``Remote access`` screen, enable SSH and select password
   authentication. If SSH is not enabled, you will not be able to follow this
   guide to log in to the Raspberry Pi remotely from another computer.

9. **Review the write settings.**

   On the ``Writing`` screen, confirm the Raspberry Pi model, operating system,
   storage device, hostname, user account, Wi-Fi network, and SSH settings.
   Then click ``WRITE``.

10. **Confirm the erase and write operation.**

    Check the target storage device once more. If it is correct, click
    ``I UNDERSTAND, ERASE AND WRITE``.

11. **Wait for writing and verification to finish.**

    Do not remove the microSD card or card reader, or close Raspberry Pi Imager,
    while the write operation is in progress.

12. **Safely remove the microSD card.**

    When ``Write complete`` appears, confirm that the storage device has been
    ejected, then safely remove the microSD card.

Keep the microSD card ready for the HAT installation in the next chapter. If
Raspberry Pi Imager reports a verification failure, try a different card
reader, microSD card, or USB port, then write the image again.
